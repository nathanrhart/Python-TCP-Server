# Python-TCP-Server
A simple Python3 TCP Server and Client for very basic input and response

This was part of a portfolio, uploaded in the interest of perhaps future use.

Very basic handling of multiple inputs and outputs, all in the format of booking plane tickets.
Currently session ending is off as the server doesn't know when the user is finished.
